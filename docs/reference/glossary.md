# TorchLens glossary

This glossary fixes the public meaning of TorchLens terms. It describes the current 2.x API;
removed spellings are listed separately in [Deprecations](deprecations.md).

## Capture products

**Trace**
: The finalized record of one executed path: operations, dataflow edges, module context, selected
  payloads, and capture metadata. `tl.trace(...)` returns a `Trace`.

**Recording**
: A sparse, torch-only event stream returned by `tl.record(model, inputs, save=...)`.
  `Recording.to_trace()` materializes full graph structure; reading a payload that was not selected
  by `save=` fails explicitly.

**PartialTrace**
: A recoverable prefix of a failed `tl.trace(...)` capture. A raised capture exception may expose
  `exc.partial_log`; recover it with `tl.partial.from_failed_capture(exc)`. A partial trace is not
  silently treated as complete.

**Failed partial Recording**
: A `Recording` with `status="partial_error"` and `failed=True`. Use
  `on_forward_error="attach_partial"` to attach it as `exc.partial_recording`, or
  `on_forward_error="return_partial"` to return it. It carries string-only error metadata,
  `n_ops_completed`, and best-effort `last_event_*` fields. It cannot be passed to
  `Recording.to_trace()` or `Recording.log_backward()`.

**Capture outcome**
: The frozen `Trace.outcome`, `Recording.outcome`, or `PartialTrace.outcome`. Its status is one of
  `COMPLETE`, `HALTED`, `ABORTED_NONFINITE`, `FAILED`, `UNATTESTED`, or `UNKNOWN`; failed outcomes
  also identify the phase. See [Capture outcomes](capture_outcomes.md).

## Graph records

**Op**
: One executed callable invocation. Ops are the dataflow graph's nodes and have unique full labels
  such as `relu_1_2`.

**Layer**
: The user-facing grouping of equivalent or recurrent Ops. A recurrent layer may have multiple
  passes, addressed with a one-based suffix such as `linear_1:2`.

**Module**
: A captured framework module or backend-neutral module-like object. A module contains Ops but is
  not itself an Op.

**Parameter / Buffer**
: Registered model state. Parameters are trainable state; buffers are non-parameter state and may
  have multiple captured versions. A training-mode `BatchNorm2d` collapse label can say
  “5 layers total” because it counts the parameter leaves `weight` and `bias` plus the buffer
  leaves `running_mean`, `running_var`, and `num_batches_tracked`; it is not claiming five
  BatchNorm calls.

**GradFn**
: A first-class live backward-autograd node captured during backward logging. Portable artifacts
  do not contain PyTorch's live autograd graph.

**Facet**
: A named semantic view into one captured value, such as an attention projection or an LSTM state.

## Selection and storage

**Predicate**
: A site selector built with `tl.func`, `tl.module`, `tl.in_module`, `tl.label`, and boolean or
  temporal composition. `save=` is the only selective sparse-capture spelling; removed
  `keep_op=` and `keep_module=` arguments raise `TypeError`.

**Lookback**
: A bounded window of earlier metadata or detached payloads retained so a later temporal predicate
  can select its predecessors.

**Save mode**
: The activation-retention policy: `copy` isolates the retained value, `reference` preserves the
  live autograd-capable object, and `view` intentionally leaves aliasing visible.

**Streaming storage**
: A `storage=tl.to_disk(...)` capture that writes selected payloads while capture proceeds. It is
  distinct from saving a completed in-memory Trace.

**Capture cache**
: The opt-in `cache=True` content-hash store of finished captures. A hit requires the model's
  tensor content (including device and `requires_grad`), training flags, module tree and
  `forward` code, plain instance attributes, user-registered module hooks, inputs, and capture
  configuration to all match. Entries are HMAC-authenticated, bounded by entry count and bytes,
  and `tl.clear_capture_cache()` empties the cache while preserving its secret.

## Replay and intervention

**Intervention**
: A value or gradient edit performed at a selected live site. `tl.when(predicate, helper)` binds a
  selector to helpers such as `tl.zero_ablate()` or `tl.scale(...)`.

**Bundle**
: A named collection of aligned Traces, constructed with `tl.bundle(...)` or `tl.Bundle(...)`, for
  cross-run comparison.

**Runnable artifact**
: A `.tlspec` saved at `level="runnable"` with a sparse taken-path descriptor. Its source capture
  must use `intervention_ready=True`; this flag supplies replay templates even when no intervention
  is planned.

**Readiness**
: The non-executing runnable state `ready` or `unavailable`.

**Path faithfulness**
: A runnable result verdict: `verified`, `diverged`, or `unverifiable`. `unverifiable` means the run
  completed without enough evidence for the stronger claim; it is not a pass.

**Numeric attestation**
: Byte-level comparison of eligible archived selected activations. Its status is `attested`,
  `numeric_attestation_failed`, `not_applicable`, or `not_present`; attestation never upgrades path
  faithfulness.

## Capture honesty and visualization

**Capture verification reason**
: The machine-readable `Trace.capture_verification_reason` explaining why a live capture is not
  positively verified, for example `mode_rescue_rerun`, `escape_rescue_unrecovered`,
  `owner_thread_tripwire_changed`, or `dynamo_region_not_logged`.

**Rescue re-run**
: A single disclosed second forward under a `TorchFunctionMode` net that redirects detected stale
  pre-wrap torch references to their wrappers. The trace records `trace.rescue_rerun` and reason
  `mode_rescue_rerun`.

**Collapse**
: A rendering-only condensation of module detail. `collapse="none"`, `"auto"`, `"max"`, or a
  float in `[0, 1]` never changes the underlying Trace.

**Run folding**
: `fold_repeats=True` replaces eligible runs of distinct same-class sibling modules with a
  representative and an honest `+N more` label. It differs from recurrence, where `(xN)` means the
  same parameters executed repeatedly.

**Receptive field / Projective field**
: Influence geometry through the captured DAG toward inputs / toward outputs. Entity-level
  `op.receptive_field` and `op.projective_field` pair with Trace-level
  `Trace.receptive_fields()` and `Trace.projective_fields()` tables.

## Backend-neutral identity

**Backend**
: `Trace.backend`, such as `torch`, `jax`, `mlx`, `tinygrad`, `paddle`, or `tf`.

**Module identity mode**
: `Trace.module_identity_mode`, describing how the backend identifies module-like ownership.

**Backend address / resolver status**
: Portable origin and resolution fields for backend records. They travel with `param_source`,
  `dtype_ref`, and `device_ref`; none should be inferred from a torch-only object when a
  backend-neutral field exists.
