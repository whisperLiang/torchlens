"""Per-package coverage floors for the nightly smoke-tier coverage gate.

r7 R72 (sol b9 MED): the only coverage gate was a single 55% aggregate, so a
meaningful capture/postprocess/validation coverage loss could ship while the
total stayed above the bar. These floors bind the verdict-critical packages
individually, each set ~6-7 points under its measured smoke-tier coverage
(dev-box measurement 2026-08-16, branch coverage, statements+branches) so
environment variance never trips them while a subsystem hollowing always
does.

SHRINK-FORBIDDEN: never lower a floor to pass — root-cause the coverage loss
(tests/test_coverage_floor_governance.py pins the invocation and refuses
floor cuts). Raise floors as measured coverage grows.

Usage: check_package_coverage_floors.py COVERAGE_JSON
(the json produced by ``--cov-report=json:<path>``).
