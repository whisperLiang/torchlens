"""Shared receptive-field rule-registry isolation for the RF test suite.

Every ``tests/test_rf_*.py`` file needs the same process-global hygiene: the
RF rule registry (``torchlens.receptive_field._rules._RF_RULES``) and its
cache-invalidation epoch (``_RF_RULES_EPOCH``) must be snapshotted before a
test mutates them and restored exactly afterwards. Historically each file
hand-rolled one of three fixture variants; this module centralizes all of
them behind one context manager so the semantics stay identical everywhere
(R77 fixture-health round 3).

Variants expressed as arguments:

* ``preserved_rf_registry(bump_epoch=True)`` -- snapshot, clear the registry,
  bump the epoch (invalidates solved-DAG caches for the test body), restore.
* ``preserved_rf_registry(clear=False)`` -- snapshot only; the test keeps the
  currently installed rules and any additions are rolled back on exit.
* ``preserved_rf_registry(install_builtin=True)`` -- snapshot, clear, then
  install the built-in rule pack (captured lazily once per process and
  reused, exactly like the historical per-file ``_PACK`` caches), restore.

    Notes
    -----
    The pack is captured lazily ONCE per process: the first caller imports
    ``torchlens.receptive_field.rules`` and, when the registry is still empty
    (the idempotent import-time install already ran earlier in the process),
    reloads each built-in rule module so its registration decorators re-fire.
    Later callers replay the cached snapshot without touching the modules.

        Whether to advance ``_RF_RULES_EPOCH`` after clearing so cached
        solutions keyed on the epoch are invalidated for the block. Only
        meaningful with ``clear=True``.

    Yields
    ------
    None
        Runs the managed block, then restores the exact prior registry
        contents and epoch (also on exception).
