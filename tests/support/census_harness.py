"""Capture-fidelity census harness (merge-ranks C0 -> C2/C3; wave-0 build).

The census is the relaxation gate of the merge-ranks tier: per candidate
topology, run the workload twice -- BARE under the reference observers
(ground-truth streams) and under FULL TorchLens capture -- and require
(design-merge-ranks-c v5, 5.2 + the L8 census plan sec 1.1):

1. K1 non-perturbation: bit-identical outputs AND final parameter/buffer
   bytes AND torch/python RNG engine states, clean-bare vs captured;
2. K2 plane-P completeness: every mode-visible op (any namespace) accounted
   for in the trace;
3. K3 collective + completion accounting over the UNION of the mode stream
   and the dispatcher-interposition inventory, with the no-double-tick seq
   invariant;
4. K4 total plane-S/plane-P linkage.

Ground truth is DUAL-CHANNEL: a ``TorchDispatchMode`` provably does NOT see
ACT-triggered ``wait_tensor`` (plan probe P2), so the bare leg runs the
mode logger AND dispatcher-level ``torch.library.Library(..., "IMPL")``
interposition counters over completion ops. K1's baseline is a THIRD, fully
clean bare run; a harness self-check pins that the instrumented bare leg
matches the clean leg bit-identically, which simultaneously proves the
counters non-perturbing.

Wave 0 landed: the row registry, the widened ``CensusResult`` with the
full-conjunction ``row_green`` gate, the dual-channel bare leg, criterion 1
(widened), the refusal-row runner, and the report generator.

Wave 1 (C2 recording lane) fills the criteria 2-4 BODIES over the plane-P
dispatch journal armed captures now carry (``trace._distributed_plane_p``,
session-only) plus the boundary journal and the issue-time seq counters:

* K2 -- multiset coverage of the bare mode stream by the captured plane-P
  accounting universe (live records plus boundary-discharged interiors;
  TorchLens' own paused instrumentation reads are excluded);
* K3 -- collective-namespace accounting: no undischarged collective dispatch,
  completion bindings observed or typed-fallback, and the no-double-tick seq
  invariant (per-(group_uid, channel) seq delta == journaled boundaries);
* K4 -- linkage totality: zero orphan plane-P records (no wrapper owner, no
  module context, not boundary-discharged, not TorchLens-internal).

Requesting criteria 2-4 on a capture WITHOUT a plane-P journal (unarmed) still
raises, so a green can never be vacuous about which criteria ran. The wave-0
per-row product name and the row_green conjunction are unchanged.
