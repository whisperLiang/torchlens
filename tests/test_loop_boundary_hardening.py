"""Hardening tests for param-free ops at loop boundaries (rounds 22-25).

Locks the round-25 TOPOLOGICAL REDESIGN of bare (unanchored, parameter-free)
op grouping. A bare op's layer membership is no longer guessed from context-set
heuristics (the r22 disjoint-context veto, r23 any-inequality veto plus
entry adoption, r24 global carrier census); it is DERIVED from its parents'
already-solved grouping: every bare op carries a signature -- the multiset of
its parents' pass-free site colors (parameterized call identity, anchored key,
bare-op class, external label) -- and same-key ops partition into the coarsest
classes consistent with that evidence. Lockstep iterations of one source-code
site produce EQUAL signatures by construction; sites whose parameterized
direct parents differ in LAYER split by construction. The one honest same-site
signature difference, the loop ENTRY (pass 1 reads pre-loop state, later
passes read the feedback wire), is re-admitted through a guarded carry-slot
exemption; loop-invariant-fed repeats (in-body factory ops, recomputes of a
pre-loop value) sequence through their consumers instead.

The correctness bar throughout is LOCKSTEP PASS-COHERENCE: sibling bare ops
executing once per iteration of one loop body must partition identically, and
a bare op's per-layer pass counts must mirror its own loop's parameterized
flanks -- never straddle a boundary (a 3-pass and a 2-pass layer cannot share
a 5-pass neighbor).

Two DELIBERATE policy changes from the pre-r25 heuristic ladder, both locked
below with rationale:

* Alternating-site straight-line residual bodies (``h = h + attn(h); h = h +
  mlp(h)`` per iteration) now split PER SITE ([3, 3]), not per loop ([6]): the
  attn-add and the mlp-add are different source-code sites with different
  parameterized direct parents, and [6] beside attn [3] / mlp [3] violated the
  very neighbor-coherence standard the boundary work defends.
* The n1=1 "peeled entry" chain (``for 1: ... ; for 2: ...`` over distinct
  sites) no longer fuses the binary bridge op into the second loop ([3] ->
  [1, 2]): the peeled add's parameterized flank (enc, one pass) positively
  contradicts the second loop's flank (dec, two passes), so [1, 2] is the
  flank-lockstep answer. Flankless unary ops (the tanh head) carry no such
  contradicting evidence and keep the adoption shape ([3]), mirroring the
  accepted singleton-prelude adoption family.
