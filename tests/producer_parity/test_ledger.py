"""Consumer-ledger generation and closure gates (P0).

Regenerates the ledger from the tree and the scenario battery every run,
asserts the closure properties, and DIFFS the regenerated inventory against the
git-tracked artifacts next to this test, so P2 keeps a reviewable migration
checklist and producer/consumer drift is a red test rather than a silent
rewrite.

Finding B1-14: the gate used to ``write_text`` all four inventories and then
assert only set/closure properties, so a run was green *while overwriting the
tracked files*. The checked-in content had rotted accordingly -- ``runtime_reads
.json`` recorded absolute caller paths from a long-deleted worktree, and every
location was stale by thousands of lines -- and CI could not distinguish a
reviewed ledger refresh from unreviewed drift.

Two halves fix it:

1. **Normalized artifacts.** The tracked payloads are machine-independent and
   stable under unrelated edits: locations are repo-relative, line numbers are
   replaced by a per-``(file, ...)`` SITE COUNT (so a new site in an
   already-listed file is still drift), and callers outside the repo collapse to
   ``<external>`` (a venv path and its torch-version line numbers are not a
   producer fact). Exact lines stay greppable from the file+field pair.
2. **Compare, never write.** A normal run only compares. Refreshing is an
   explicit, reviewed act behind :data:`_REFRESH_ENV`.
