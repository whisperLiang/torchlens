"""Closed ledger of sanctioned in-place op-lane writers (r7 R03-1).

The producer contract says the op lane is append-only with post-commit
knowledge riding the typed amendment lane -- but the fastlog ancestry-closure
backfill legitimately REPLACES op-lane cells in place on the ``copy_for_replay``
projection a cook owns. That carve-out lived in exactly one function docstring:
no contract named it, and a subscript assignment (``op_events[i] = ...``) is
invisible to the name-based P4 AST guard that pins the amendment call sites. A
second in-place writer landing anywhere else -- especially one that forgets the
``_amended_fold_cache`` invalidation or runs on a journal that is NOT a
cook-owned projection -- would pass every producer gate silently.

This gate closes that ceiling: every mutation of an ``op_events`` container
anywhere in the shipped package (subscript/slice assignment, ``del``, and the
mutating list methods) must appear in the reason-bearing sanctioned ledger,
EXACTLY -- a new writer is red until it is consciously ledgered, and a retired
writer is red until it is removed here.
