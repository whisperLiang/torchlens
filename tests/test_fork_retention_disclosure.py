"""Fork retention: calibrated measurement + regression ceilings.

The COW fork shares tensor payloads and sealed columns but is NOT near-free
in objects: measured ~61 gc-tracked objects (~13.5 KB of small allocations)
per op on a small conv/BN/relu stack -- ~68% of a steady-state capture's
tracked-object retention (disclosed in ``_trace_fork`` and ``Trace.fork``).

MEASUREMENT-BUG GUARDS (a prior probe over-counted retention 20x): the census
must first prove itself on a no-op (delta 0) and a known allocation counted
exactly. Two CPython traps make uncalibrated counts meaningless:
``gc.get_objects()`` sees only TRACKED objects (``object()`` instances never
appear), and a collection UNTRACKS atomic-only dicts/tuples (10k empty dicts
count as ~1 after a collect). Calibration uses lists, which stay tracked.
