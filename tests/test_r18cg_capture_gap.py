"""Regression guards for the torch-2.13 arg-spec capture-gap fix (R18CG).

Two related findings surfaced while reconciling ``tests/test_arg_spec_coverage.py`` against
torch 2.13:

* ``torch.align_as`` (the named-tensor ``Tensor.align_as`` method) was REMOVED in torch 2.13. It
  is therefore version-varying: still decorated on the pinned torch<=2.12 CI legs, absent on
  2.13. Its static arg-spec is retained in ``arg_positions.py`` for the older legs, but it is
  dropped from the high-confidence "must be decorated on every leg" set.

* ``torch.rand_like`` / ``torch.randn_like`` / ``torch.randint_like`` are real public torch
  factories that were NOT wrapped: they are in torch's ``get_ignored_functions()`` (not
  overridable via ``__torch_function__``) but were absent from ``torchlens.constants.IGNORED_FUNCS``
  -- unlike their non-``_like`` siblings ``rand`` / ``randn`` / ``randint``. A forward that called
  them recorded the output as an unattributed literal (the r45 ``.mH`` capture-gap class). The fix
  adds the three factories to ``IGNORED_FUNCS`` so they decorate and capture; their arg-specs
  already existed (``_FACTORY_SOURCE_SPEC`` / the ``randintlike`` entry).
