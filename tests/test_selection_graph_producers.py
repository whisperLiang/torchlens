"""Graph-structural producers + TraceSlice: acceptance and honesty gates.

Covers the graph-lane obligations: ``neighborhood`` / ``between`` return
composable ``Selection`` queries whose member sets are verified against
hand-computed hop sets and path regions on a branchy model, family
semantics (element masks never shrink a graph region), pinned ``exact``
provenance, parity with the shipped influence-geometry ``between_labels``
machinery, the typed refusal matrix (kind, unknown sites, bad parameters),
multi-pass (recurrence-grouped) traversal over pass-qualified nodes, the
``TraceSlice`` presenter contract (members, internal edges, EXPLICIT
boundary declaration, entry/exit ops, teaching lookup misses, frozen
surface, algebra lift, the ``do()`` gallery row), and the
``slice_save_unsupported`` save refusal.
