"""B8-18: a captured conditional must not leak an absolute source path on save.

``Trace.conditional_records`` holds ``ConditionalEvent`` objects whose
``source_file`` is the ABSOLUTE path of the user's ``forward``-defining module.
Those dataclasses had no ``PORTABLE_STATE_SPEC``, so the scrubber returned them
verbatim and the source-path relativizer never ran -- the absolute path (with its
``$HOME``, OS username, and filesystem layout) persisted into ``metadata.pkl`` at
EVERY save level, INCLUDING ``include_source=False``. That is a direct regression
of the source-privacy guarantee the scrubber documents for every other
source-bearing record (``Trace``/``Module``/``FuncCallLocation``).
