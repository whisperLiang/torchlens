"""Regression tests for the unattributed-tensor-argument witness false positive.

Context
-------
The postprocess "no graph/source provenance" witness
(``torchlens.postprocess._warn_unattributed_tensor_args``, fed by
``torchlens.backends.torch.ops._unattributed_tensor_arg_positions``) exists to
catch capture gaps: tensors that flow into an op with no traced provenance. Its
branch (2) additionally flags a *provenanced* tensor whose producer label is not
one of the op's recorded parent edges.

That branch (2) mis-fired on dynamic-shape families: a scalar tensor that is
fully traced (``has_known_provenance``) but is consumed as a **size/shape**
argument (a ``torch.zeros`` size dim, a ``view``/``reshape``/``as_strided`` size
arg, a ``new_zeros`` size element) is deliberately excluded from the op's
recorded parents, so branch (2) wrongly promoted it to an error. This broke
``test_packed_sequence`` (LSTM internal ``h0``/``c0`` allocation) and
``test_longformer`` (windowed-attention dynamic dims).

Round-31 H2 superseded the schema classifier that used to narrow branch (2):
a runtime TENSOR at any input slot -- including schema-typed ``int``/``Scalar``
control slots such as factory size dims -- is a real data dependency, and the
extraction coverage guard now records it as a graph PARENT. The dynamic-shape
families that motivated the old narrowing therefore no longer produce
unattributed provenanced tensors at all (the size producer is an attributed
parent), and branch (2) stays armed at EVERY slot: a provenanced tensor missing
from the recorded parents is a dropped edge wherever it sits. An UN-provenanced
tensor at any position is caught earlier by branch (1), unchanged.
