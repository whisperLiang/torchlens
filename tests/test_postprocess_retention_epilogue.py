"""B1-18: the H2 hot-AST release is a TOTAL postprocess epilogue.

``ast_branches`` keeps a process-wide, 256-file-bounded ``_file_cache`` split
into a cold tier (spans, projected calls, retained source) and a hot tier
(``_HeavyAst``: parsed module AST, parent map, scope nodes) for whole source
files -- including torch-library files. The H2 retention seal drops the hot
tier at the postprocess epilogue so no capture leaves multi-megabyte ASTs
pinned between captures.

That drop used to be a success-path STATEMENT at the end of ``postprocess()``,
so any failure inside steps 0-20 or the core freeze skipped it and the hot tier
survived. Distinct failing files accumulate up to the cache bound, which
resurrects exactly the retention class the seal exists to close. It now runs in
a ``finally``.

Releasing is safe on every exit by design: the cold tier survives, so a later
query for an unprojected scope re-parses from RETAINED source (never disk).
