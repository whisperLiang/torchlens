"""L6 stage 4a: the FULL ACCEPTANCE GALLERY (design memo sec 3.4).

The flagship composition demo of the selection algebra: ablate the
INTERSECTION of two units' receptive fields vs their UNION vs a size-matched
seeded RANDOM CONTROL, using the exact METAPLAN producer-to-producer
spelling (``u.receptive_field.at(p) & u.receptive_field.at(q)`` — no
explicit conversion calls).

THE COMMITTED ARTIFACT: seed 0, float64 CPU convs (outside the oneDNN
Winograd selection domain — the memo's pinned arithmetic assumption for
A1's exact zero), two stacked 3x3 convs on a 1x1x12x12 input; u1/u2 are the
late-conv units at channel 0 position (3, 3) and channel 1 position (5, 5),
whose input receptive fields are the 5x5 boxes [3:8]^2 and [5:10]^2
(overlap [5:8]^2 = 9 elements). Build-time verification measured (and this
suite re-asserts):

  inter ablation: d_u1 = 7.742e-3, d_u2 = 4.617e-2, d_out = 6.82e-2
  union ablation: d_u1 = 1.724e-1, d_u2 = 3.122e-2, d_out = 2.22e-1
  ctrl  ablation: d_u1 = 0.0 EXACTLY, d_u2 = 0.0 EXACTLY, d_out = 9.51e-2

The assertion honesty split (memo 3.4):
  A1 [THEOREM under exact geometry + direct convolution arithmetic]: the
     control ablation changes u1 and u2 by EXACTLY ZERO — zero tolerance;
     doubles as an RF-containment tripwire.
  A2 [PINNED-ARTIFACT REGRESSION]: the intersection ablation moves BOTH
     units above the stated floor (1e-3; measured min 7.7e-3). Not a
     theorem — signed weights permit cancellation; the committed artifact
     was verified at build to clear the floor. A red here means the
     artifact changed: that is the signal.
  A3 [REPORTED + cardinality THEOREM]: union-vs-inter per-unit magnitudes
     are REPORTED, never asserted (this very artifact shows the legal
     inversion: union's d_u2 < inter's d_u2 — superset ablation with a
     SMALLER delta via cancellation). Asserted: |inter| <= |union| and
     inter is element-nonempty — exact by construction.
  A4 [CONSTRUCTION]: |ctrl| == |inter| (size-matched by construction).

The gallery doubles as documentation of the algebra (three compositions +
one kind refusal) and closes with the stage-4a cross-run patching rows.
