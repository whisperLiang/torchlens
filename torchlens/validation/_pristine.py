"""Pristine-torch context for wrap-state-independent validation oracles.

R75-1 (b9-fable round-2, probe-proven): once torch is wrapped, EVERY
in-process value oracle -- the phase-0 ground-truth forward, the per-op
replay (which calls the wrapper-closure ``canonical_capture_callable``),
and backward validation's "stock autograd" forward -- observes through the
same installed wrapper shells. A TorchLens-induced numeric distortion (a
planted 0.1% ``tanh`` distortion in the wrapper layer) therefore validated
CLEAN in a wrapped process and was caught only in a fresh one: the verdict
on the identical model and bug depended on whether any capture had run
earlier in the process.

The fix: the ground-truth oracles run with the wrappers REMOVED
(``unwrap_torch``) and reinstalled afterwards. ``unwrap_torch`` restores
each callable from the append-only ``_decorated_to_orig`` ledger, whose
orig side is recorded by the wrap machinery BEFORE the decorator sees the
function -- so a corrupted decorator cannot poison the restoration, which
is exactly what makes this a genuinely independent observation root.
Re-install is cheap (cached wrapper maps; no re-decoration).

Residual, disclosed (r4 census MED-2 scope correction): the per-op replay
still executes the RECORDED capture callable, so replay alone remains
wrap-state-correlated. With the phase-0 ground truth pristine, a
wrapper-layer distortion that REACHES the final output diverges from
ground truth and fails validation regardless of process wrap state --
that (and only that) is the class the probe proved closed. A distortion
MASKED downstream (a saturating clamp, a sign/argmax head) matches the
pristine final output AND matches its own corrupt replay, so it still
validates clean in-process; the cross-process mode-vs-wrapper
differential harness (``tools/differential_capture.py``) is the
independent root for that masked-interior class, and
``tests/test_validation_pristine_ground_truth.py`` pins the boundary.

Ledger integrity (r4 census MED-1): ``_decorated_to_orig`` is the SINGLE
shared root behind capture's orig grab, this oracle's restoration, and
sparse-runnable callable resolution -- a ledger entry whose "orig" is
itself a TorchLens wrapper (the orphaned prior-generation-snapshot
failure mode) would make the "pristine" forward run a wrapper and bless
coherently-corrupt captures. Wrappers are structurally identifiable
(``__tl_wrapper_name__`` is stamped at construction), so the oracle
scans the ledger before unwrapping and REFUSES on any wrapper-marked
orig value rather than blessing through a poisoned restoration.

If the wrappers cannot be removed (a capture is active on this thread --
only reachable by calling validation from inside a traced forward), the
caller must REFUSE to bless rather than silently validating through the
wrapper root; ``pristine_torch_oracle`` propagates the typed
``CaptureContextError`` for the caller to convert into a fail-closed
verdict.

    ------
    bool

        never wrapped in this process, or the wrappers were removed for the
        block and are reinstalled on exit (with the process-level escape
        detector and completeness-witness modes preserved -- teardown resets

        or the unwrap ledger records a wrapper as an original callable
        (``code="pristine_ledger_poisoned"``). Callers convert either into
