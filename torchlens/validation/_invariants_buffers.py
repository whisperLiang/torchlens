    """Build a one-pass primary/alias address -> Param index.

    Replaces a per-lookup linear scan over ``ml.param_logs``. Co-parent
    resolution runs once per param, so the scan made ``param_xrefs`` quadratic in
    the parameter count: every weight-tied or bias/weight sibling link re-walked
    the whole parameter list (800 lookups x 800 params on an 800-layer chain).

    First writer wins, which reproduces the scan's short-circuit order exactly:
    the scan returned the FIRST param matching on either its primary address or
    one of its aliases, and within one param it tested the primary before the
    aliases. Iterating params in the same order and refusing to overwrite an
    existing key therefore resolves every address to the same Param the scan
    picked.

    The ``address`` key is inserted even when it is ``None`` (missing or unset
    attribute). The scan compared with ``getattr(param, "address", None) ==
    address``, so a ``None`` query legitimately matched an addressless param;
    dropping such keys would silently turn that into an unresolved-co-parent
    failure. Indexing requires hashable keys where the scan only needed ``==``.
    That is satisfied: primary addresses already key ``ParamAccessor._dict``, and
    ``all_addresses`` is seeded with the primary address and only ever grows by
    appending module-path alias strings (weight tying), so every key is a ``str``.

    Precondition contract: torch registered buffers are represented by
