"""Validation-owned independent output-tensor traversal (b9 R74/75-1).

Ground-truth output enumeration used to share its root with capture: both
``backends/torch/backend.py`` (output extraction) and the validation oracle
resolved through ``backends.torch.ops._walk_output_tensors_with_paths``, so a
walker defect made capture AND the oracle drop the same output leaf and
``validate_forward_pass`` returned True over a missing output (sol's live
plant). This module is the independent second root: a deliberately small,
self-contained traversal that must NEVER import from ``torchlens.backends``
-- ``tests/test_output_walker_independence.py`` enforces that structurally.

It is a CROSS-CHECK, not a replacement: capture's adapter defines the
agreed container semantics (registered containers, structseqs, dedup rules),
so validation still feeds the adapter's enumeration to the replay pipeline
and FAILS the run when this walker disagrees about the tensor-leaf identity
set, instead of silently inheriting the adapter's blind spot.
