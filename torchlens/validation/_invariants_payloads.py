def _check_edge_use_parent_arg_invariants(ml: Trace) -> None:
    """Check existing edge-use records and parent-arg references.

    Precondition contract: edge-use metadata is optional on torch graph edges.
    The torch eager builder emits ``_edge_uses`` only for args/kwargs-derived
    parent entries. Buffer-source, output, control, module, and
    intervention-injected edges may legitimately have no edge-use record. When
    an ``_edge_uses`` record exists, its kind must be in ``EdgeUseKind`` and
    its parent/child labels must resolve. When a ``parent_arg_positions`` entry
    exists, its referenced parent label must resolve. This invariant never
    asserts that every parent edge has a corresponding edge-use record.

    Edge-occurrence MULTIPLICITY witness (b9-opus R75-1): on live frozen
    torch traces the canonical CSR dataflow edge-occurrence table
    (``_trace_core/relations.py``) is additionally cross-checked per
    (child, parent) against the independently stored roots -- the row's
    ``parents`` entries plus its per-position ``parent_arg_positions`` map.
    The correspondence is EXACT EQUALITY by construction of the freeze
    (``relation_views.py`` pass 2 emits, for every parents-list entry that
    resolves, one occurrence per attributed arg position naming that parent,
    or exactly one when no position names it), and it was verified
    empirically on plain MLPs, genuine double consumption (``h + h``, which
    legitimately records parallel occurrences), same-tensor multi-position
    ops, recurrent loops (pass-qualified parent labels are unresolved on
    BOTH sides, so they cancel), and buffer-carrying models. Genuine
    parallel edges therefore stay green, while DUPLICATING one occurrence
    in the edge table -- invisible to every deduped label view and to the
    per-position arg map -- breaks the count equality and fails here.
    Loaded, preview, and detached traces carry no CSR edge table
    (``dataflow_edges is None``), so the multiplicity witness is vacuous
    there by precondition, exactly like the freeze it mirrors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ml:

    Raises
    ------
    MetadataInvariantError
        If populated edge-use or parent-arg-position metadata is malformed,

        canonical edge table's per-(child, parent) occurrence counts disagree
        with the parents/parent-arg-position roots.

    """Check saved and transformed live payload metadata.

    Precondition contract: tensor payload fields may be legitimately absent
    because of selective save, loaded traces, detached/audit-only metadata,
    disk-only storage, streaming finalization, or gradient eviction. This check
    compares shape, dtype, and memory only when a live payload object is
    present. Presence of a live raw or transformed activation requires
    ``has_saved_activation=True``; presence of a live raw or transformed
    gradient requires ``has_grad=True``. Missing payloads never imply
    corruption by themselves.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ml:
        Postprocessed torch trace to validate.

    ------
    MetadataInvariantError
