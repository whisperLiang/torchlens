) -> bool:
    """Return whether a slot mismatch is a provably-benign BLAS-layout artifact.

    True only when BOTH the recomputed and archived values are real tensors, the
    producing op is a known layout/reduction-order-sensitive BLAS kernel, and the
    recomputed value sits within a tight ULP band of the archive. Used solely as
    the F1 fallback: such a slot reports ``not_applicable`` instead of raising,
    because a byte-faithful replay is genuinely infeasible from the no-grad run
    path. Every other mismatch (non-BLAS op, larger-than-ULP divergence, or a
    non-tensor slot) still raises ``numeric_attestation_failed``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    descriptor:
        Sparse descriptor naming the producing op.
    member:
        Archived activation member under attestation.
    recomputed:
        Fresh replay value for the slot.
    archived_value:
        Capture-time archived value for the slot (byte-verified intact by caller).

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Whether the mismatch is the sanctioned layout-nonreproducible case.
