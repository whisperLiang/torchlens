"""Load-time rehydration of a coreless trace into the columnar store (F9).

``_trace_core`` is ``FieldPolicy.DROP``, so every unpickled Trace (plain
pickle AND ``.tlspec`` bundle loads, which route through the same
``__setstate__``) used to arrive as a dict-backed ISLAND: one detached
single-row store per record, no shared edge table, no group sharing —
outside the single-truth architecture entirely.

``rehydrate_trace_core`` runs at the end of ``Trace.__setstate__``: it
adopts every restored ``Op`` into one fresh per-trace ``OpRowStore``, the
non-Op record facades into their kind tables, then replays the standard
relation freeze (dataflow -> edge-occurrence CSR, interned views, shared
``GroupRef`` group tables — whose conversion explicitly coalesces the
equal-but-distinct members a pickle round-trip produces — and fact
pooling) and seals the store exactly like the capture-time freeze seam
(columnar transpose above the row threshold).

Boundaries (documented, tested):

* PARTIAL / FAILED captures are exempt: their staging surface is
  documented as staying raw, so a load must not run the relation freeze
  on them. The ``_tracing_finished`` master switch (``FieldPolicy.KEEP``)
  gates rehydration.
* Module / ModuleCall facades do not exist at ``__setstate__`` time
  (pickle strips ``_module_logs``; ``.tlspec`` loads rebuild it later
  through ``_io.accessor_rebuild``, which adopts them into the kind
  tables at that point). Plain pickle loads legitimately have none.
* Backward records (``GradFn``/``GradFnCall``/``BackwardPass``) stay
  detached-backed — loaded traces have no event stream, so there is no
  epoch to rebuild; a NEW backward on the restored trace binds fresh
  epochs through the normal projection path.
* Rehydration is strictly best-effort AND all-or-nothing: the op set is
  validated BEFORE anything is re-bound (a mixed-ownership or
  layout-drifted op set aborts with zero mutations), adoption copies each
  detached row's cells (the relation freeze mutates adopted rows in
  place, so the detached stores must never share the lists), and any
  unexpected failure later rolls every adopted binding back to its
  detached store — a load never fails because of it, no partial-adoption
  island can survive, and a failed rehydration leaves the detached
  topology byte-identical.
* Compaction passes are not re-run: pickle already preserves shared
  identity within one artifact, so pooled metadata stays pooled.
