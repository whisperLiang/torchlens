"""Freeze-seam Op metadata compaction (M11 fold of the standalone pass).

``compact_op_metadata`` pools repeated immutable Op metadata onto shared
instances. It used to live on ``Trace`` as ``_compact_op_metadata``; the M11
fold moved it here as a module function invoked from the core freeze seam
(torch postprocess) and the preview-backend finalizers, so the Trace surface
carries no compaction method and the freeze owns the compaction role
(trace_core_design.md section 3.3).
