"""Held torch-function reference normalization for ``release_model``.

A plain module attribute holding a torch function (``self.act = F.relu``)
captures whichever object -- pristine original or wrap-epoch wrapper -- the
name resolved to at construction time. Pickle serializes functions by
reference with a strict identity check against the CURRENT module attribute,
so a held ref from the other wrap state fails ``pickle``/``torch.save`` with
``PicklingError`` in both directions. ``release_model`` normalizes each held
ref to the value currently live at its public name so the released model is
serializable NOW, and registers the model so every later wrap-state flip
(``wrap_torch()``/``unwrap_torch()``) re-normalizes it: released stays
serializable in EVERY epoch, never a one-way trip (split out of
``model_prep.py`` under the R43 file-size ratchet -- this is the release-time
serializability seam, not preparation).

Container coverage is type-exact by design: one level of exact builtin
``list``/``tuple``/``dict``/``set``/``frozenset`` plus namedtuples (rebuilt
through ``_make`` so the runtime type survives). Other builtin subclasses are
left untouched -- a subclass can carry instance state, custom item protocols,
or constructor signatures a blind rebuild would corrupt -- and stay part of
the disclosed closures/partials/custom-container residual.
