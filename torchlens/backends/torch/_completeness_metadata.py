    Resolution is bookkeeping only -- label/ledger/live-index lookups plus a wrapper-free
    storage-pointer read under the internal marker -- so it can never recurse back into the
    metadata patches.

    COVERAGE NOTE (r75 F1, LOCKED): any unlabeled-or-unresolvable-receiver layout consumer
    in this fall-through MUST FAIL CLOSED -- a silent no-record here is exactly the r74
    ``.data``-alias false-VERIFIED reopening. The r73 version fail-OPENED on three rungs
    (label ``None``, event ``None``, empty ``input_ancestors``); each now either resolves
    POSITIVELY or downgrades completeness through ``_INPUT_METADATA_VIEW_READ`` (the same
    presence-only weak set the sibling escape nets use for this receiver class).

    Resolution ladder (:func:`_resolve_layout_rooting_labels`), then per rooting label:

    * ANCESTRY-INTEGRITY check (:func:`_layout_ancestry_tainted`): the rooting event's
      transitive parent chain must contain NO op with ``unattributed_tensor_args`` -- an

      is precisely where traced ancestry BREAKS, so recorded ``input_ancestors`` are a
      lower bound, not the truth. A tainted labeled receiver is re-resolved through the
      dispatch-origin ledger's LEAF origins (value-DAG-true through the break); an
      unresolvable taint fails closed.
    * Non-empty resolved input ancestry -> record :data:`INPUT_DERIVED_LAYOUT_FACT_NAME`
      -- carrying the rooting LEAF's capture-time stride tuple -- on each ancestor input's
      boundary site. An ancestor missing from the capture-layout map cannot pin a
      comparison basis, so the fact is recorded on EVERY mapped site instead (fail closed:
      the ceiling then keys on any input layout change).
    * Empty resolved input ancestry with a CLEAN chain (or positive state/literal-only
      ledger origins) -> genuinely state/internal-rooted: record nothing (contract
      residual (3)'s STATE side stays untouched). Empty because ancestry ORPHANED is
      unreachable here -- orphaned receivers are re-resolved or fail closed above.
