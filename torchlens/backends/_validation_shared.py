"""Backend-neutral helpers shared by the preview backends' validation modules.

The b5-parity R46-1 dedup wave hoisted the capture-side helper families into
``backends/_finalize.py`` but deferred the ``*/validation.py`` halves to the
b4-V territory owner (the copies were byte-identical across tf/mlx/paddle).
This module is that landing: validation-side helpers only, no backend
imports, safe to import from any preview backend.

The float replay tolerance derivation lives here as the ONE reviewed policy
(b5-opus R17-1): the per-backend bands were four byte-identical eps-derived
copies (tf/mlx/jax/paddle) plus two stale hold-outs -- the mlx VALIDATION
oracle kept a hardcoded decimal ladder whose fp64 band sat orders of
magnitude above fp64 round-off, and the tinygrad oracle kept a dtype-blind
fp32 decimal pair with no NaN doctrine. Unifying them is a REVIEWED
tolerance change with rationale (tightening the stale copies to the derived
band), not a casual one; any future band change edits exactly this module.

    The ONE reviewed tolerance policy for every preview backend's replay and
    validation oracle (b5-opus R17-1), replacing the dtype-blind fp32 decimal
    pair (rtol 1e-5 / atol 1e-6) that was wrong in both directions: fp64
    corruption ~4.5e9 of its own ULPs read as agreement, while a legitimate
    one-ULP fp16 storage-rounding difference false-failed.

    * Accumulating dtypes (eps <= fp32's): the legacy fp32 relative band
      rescaled by the eps ratio, so every dtype gets the SAME strictness
      measured in its own ULPs (fp32 keeps exactly the historical 1e-5).
    * Storage-rounding dtypes (eps > fp32's): values compute in a wider dtype
      and round ONCE to storage, so the legitimate replay difference is a few
      storage ULPs (4-ULP headroom).
    * The absolute term only absorbs jitter at the bottom of the representable
      range (the relative band applied to the smallest normal value); the
      former 1e-6 floor blessed TOTAL corruption of every element below it.

    Parameters
    ----------
