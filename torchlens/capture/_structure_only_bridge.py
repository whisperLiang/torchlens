"""Structure-only -> runnable bridge: entry-dark L7b wave-1 machinery.

The declared late-bind posture (design memo sec 5/8): a structure-only
capture's declared state slots carry GEOMETRY digests at capture time and
receive their VALUES at bind time, where real byte digests are computed so a
late-bound run is attestable against what was ACTUALLY bound. The
closed-vocabulary ``StateSource`` member this posture needs is an S2
AMENDMENT REQUEST (R-L7B-1) authored by the S2 author; this module therefore
ships ENTRY-DARK — pure functions with no public wiring, no new vocabulary,
no trace state — behind :data:`STRUCTURE_ONLY_BRIDGE_ENTRY_OPEN`. The
capability rows ``save_runnable`` / ``live_replay`` /
``runnable_ready_composition`` keep refusing until the amendment lands and
the L7b implementation PR flips them with evidence.

S1 CONSUMER DISCIPLINE: late-bound values validate through the published
seam surface ``validate_nonpersistent_buffer_mapping_for_descriptor``
(``torchlens/_runnable_state.py`` extension point E3); this module never
reads runnable Trace state and never adds a binding/validation layer of its
own.

DIGESTS NEVER SKIPPED (the memo's mechanical meaning, both postures):

- capture-time declared-slot digests are GEOMETRY digests under the meta
  domain tag — a real digest of everything that exists, under a tag that can
  never masquerade as content; genuine failure degrades to the manifest
  sentinel grammar ``unavailable:<ExceptionName>``, never ``None``, never
  absent;
- bind-time digests are real SHA-256 BYTE digests, mandatory: a value with
  no byte content (meta/storageless) refuses typed, and a digest failure
  refuses typed with the cause chained — never a silent skip.

G2 DOMAIN DISCIPLINE: bound values digest under the REAL tensor tag,
declared slots keep the geometry (meta-domain) tag, and the two can never
collide by construction (pinned in tests/test_structure_only_bridge.py).

NAMING: every spelling here is DOCUMENTED-UNSTABLE pending naming-session
ratification; the refusal reuses the existing closed
``state_metadata_mismatch`` vocabulary (a dedicated code, if any, is the S2
amendment's to assign — this module mints none).

    The digest is computed under the meta domain tag (``b"tensor\\0meta\\0"``

    a real tensor and its meta twin because only dtype/shape/layout enter the
