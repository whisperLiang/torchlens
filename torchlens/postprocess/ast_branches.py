"""AST indexing for boolean-context classification and branch attribution.

This module parses Python source files into a lightweight, cached index that can:

1. Classify where a captured scalar-bool operation occurred (``if`` test,
   ``elif`` test, ternary test, ``assert``, ``while``, comprehension filter,
   ``match`` guard, or standalone ``bool(...)`` cast).
2. Attribute an arbitrary operation to the enclosing conditional branch arms
   for each stack frame in ``FuncCallLocation``.

The index is structural and process-local. Dense conditional IDs are assigned
later by postprocess integration; this module works only with ``ConditionalKey``.

**Degraded mode without PEP 657 positions** (``HAS_CODE_POSITIONS`` is False,
i.e. CPython < 3.11): runtime frames carry no per-instruction column offsets,
so ``query_intervals`` falls back to line-only matching. Branch arms that
occupy distinct lines still attribute exactly; same-line arms -- notably
ternary / ``IfExp`` arms, and single-line ``if t: body`` forms -- are
DELIBERATELY dropped, because line-only evidence cannot prove which arm
executed and source-text heuristics (name matching) can lie under aliasing
(``r = torch.relu; torch.relu(x) if c else r(x)``). The posture is fail-closed:
un-attributed, never mis-attributed. Conditional events still materialize;
only the per-op arm attribution is withheld. Pinned by
``test_ternary_py310_fail_closed_model_drops_same_line_arm_attribution``.

**Hot/cold retention lifecycle.** A ``FileIndex`` has two tiers. The COLD
tier -- span-based scopes, conditionals, bool consumers, projected per-scope
call entries, and the source text -- answers every classification,
attribution, and already-projected call query without any live AST. The HOT
tier (``_HeavyAst``: the parsed module, its parent map, and the per-scope
function nodes) exists only to PROJECT call entries and is released by
``release_parsed_asts()`` at the postprocess epilogue, so the process-wide
cache never retains parsed ASTs between captures (H2: a torch-library-heavy
capture used to pin ~3.5 MB of ast nodes indefinitely). A query that needs
an unprojected scope after release re-parses from the RETAINED source text
(never the file on disk, so spans stay consistent even if the file changed),
and any re-parse anomaly fails closed to empty resolution.
