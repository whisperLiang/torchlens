    Why not ``copy.deepcopy``?  Many third-party tensor wrappers hold
    circular references back to their parent modules.  ``deepcopy`` follows
    these references recursively and either hangs or blows the stack.
    Instead we clone tensors (which copies storage without following Python
    object references) and recurse only into standard containers.

    Clones tensors, recurses into standard containers (list, tuple, dict),
    and leaves everything else as-is.  This prevents infinite loops that
    copy.deepcopy can trigger on complex tensor wrappers (e.g. ESCNN
    GeometricTensor) while still protecting user inputs from in-place
    mutations like device moves.

    Standard containers that refer back to themselves (directly or through a
    cycle of mutable containers) are handled without a ``RecursionError``: a
    mutable container being built is registered in ``_in_progress`` before its
    elements are recursed, so a self-reference resolves to the same in-progress
    copy and the cycle is reproduced in the copy.  The memo is CALL-scoped
    (retained across siblings, r-b4 R29-3): a DAG-shaped input that reuses one
    sub-container under several paths is copied ONCE and stays aliased in the
    copy -- which both matches the aliasing topology the model itself would see
    and makes the copy O(nodes).  The historical path-scoped memo copied a
    shared node once per PATH, i.e. exponentially in shared-substructure depth
    (measured x2 per level; depth 25 hung capture entry for ~4 minutes).
    Tensors remain leaves cloned per DISTINCT container occurrence and are
    never memoized.

    Note: custom objects containing tensors are passed by reference.  If the
    model is on a different device, _fetch_label_move_input_tensors may
    mutate the wrapper's tensor attribute in-place.  This is acceptable
    because pre-fix such inputs caused an infinite hang.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arg
        Argument value to copy.
    _in_progress
        Internal recursion state mapping ``id()`` of a mutable container being
        built to its (partially populated) copy, used to terminate reference
        cycles. Callers should not supply this.
    _depth
        Internal recursion depth used to enforce the shared input-boundary
        nesting ceiling (r-b4 R27-1). Callers should not supply this.
