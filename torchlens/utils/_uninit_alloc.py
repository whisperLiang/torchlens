#
# The ``empty`` factory family and a GROWING ``resize_``/``resize_as_`` produce bytes
# that are not a function of the recorded computation (allocator garbage). PyTorch
# gives these ops NO distinguishing ``torch.Tag`` (verified: ``empty`` tags are only
# ``core``/``generated``/``pt2_compliant_tag``), so the family is a maintained name
# table defended by an aten-namespace drift meta-test
# (``tests/test_tlspec_runnable_r53_uninit_alloc.py``): a new ``empty*``/``resize*``
# aten name that is neither in the family table nor in the test's justified
# non-family allowlist is a FAILING test, never a silent gap.
#
# This block is the SINGLE definition consumed by all three recognition layers:
# the load-side value-source classifier (``_runnable_execution.py``), the producer
# origin ledger (``backends/torch/completeness_witness.py``), and the pruned-orphan
# control walk (``postprocess/graph_traversal.py``). No other call site may
# re-derive uninitialized-memory nondeterminism from qualnames (source-scan
# meta-test).
