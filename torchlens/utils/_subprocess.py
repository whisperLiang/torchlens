"""The ONE bounded-subprocess spawn discipline for every TorchLens child.

Moved from ``visualization/_render_utils`` (R40): the doctor Graphviz probe
and the bundle git-provenance stamp each hand-rolled ``subprocess.run`` and
leaked orphaned grandchildren on their timeout paths, while this runner's
group teardown already solved that class. Living under ``utils`` keeps it
importable without the visualization package's hard ``graphviz`` dependency.
