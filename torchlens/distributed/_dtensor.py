"""DTensor dual-geometry extraction: logical identity for sharded state.

Merge-ranks tier (b), DTensor param identity. A DTensor's ``.shape`` is the
LOGICAL shape while the rank physically holds only a shard; every TorchLens
surface that talks about distributed tensor state must declare BOTH
geometries explicitly so no reader ever guesses which one it is looking at
(design-merge-ranks-c v5, 1.7 amendment 2). This module is the one extraction
point:

* the ``dtensor`` / ``tensor_parallel`` findings and ``tl.compat.report``
  rows attach per-site dual geometry, so a refused TP/FSDP2 model is refused
  with its parameters precisely IDENTIFIED (logical shape, placements, shard
  offset) instead of silently mis-counted;
* C0 boundary ``RoleEntry`` dual-geometry slots and the C2 rank-local capture
  substrate consume the same helper when DTensor values flow through capture.

Everything degrades gracefully: any probe failure yields ``None`` fields,
never an exception, because this code runs inside capture-entry detection.
