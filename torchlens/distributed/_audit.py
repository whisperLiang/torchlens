"""PRE-JOIN membership-lineage audit over per-rank lifecycle ledgers.

This is the cross-rank fail-closed layer above restricted local seeding
(design-merge-ranks-c v5, section 1.3). Before ANY correlation-key joining or
presence-gap derivation, the merge collects each member rank's lineage vector
for every membership appearing in two or more rank cores and audits:

1. Complete witnesses (install epoch ``armed_before_any_group``) must present
   element-wise identical lineage vectors.
2. Every ``seeded`` entry must be DISCHARGED against a one-generation complete
   witness; if any complete witness evidences two or more generations, every
   seeded entry from any other rank is unprovable and the membership refuses.
3. With no complete witness, all presenting vectors must be element-wise
   identical.
4. A conflicted membership refuses STRUCTURALLY
   (``group_lifetime_evidence_conflict``): no uid of that membership may join
   and no unmatched uid of it may become a presence gap. Enforcing that is the
   caller's (the C1 merge engine's) obligation; this module only renders the
   verdicts.

The audit is a pure function of the presented evidence so the merge engine can
call the SAME function at merge time and at load rederivation.

    -----
    Conflicts refuse structurally: the caller must ensure no correlation key
    of a conflicted membership joins and no unmatched key of it becomes a
    presence gap. A gap is a claim about missing ranks; a conflict is a claim
    that the ranks PRESENT cannot be proven to describe the same communicator
    lineage. The remedy a conflict names is arming before any group creation
