"""Device/layout-aware host transport for tensor digest and codec paths.

The historical spelling ``tensor.detach().cpu().contiguous()`` is a no-op on the
common already-contiguous CPU path, but for a CROSS-DEVICE source with a
dense-permuted layout (channels_last / transposed-dense) ``.cpu()`` preserves the
permuted strides (``Tensor.cpu`` defaults to ``memory_format=preserve_format``),
so the trailing ``.contiguous()`` forces a SECOND full materialization — a 2x
transient host peak on exactly the payloads GPU CNN workflows produce
(disputed-r2 b5/R35).

The naive one-line replacement ``.to("cpu", memory_format=contiguous_format)`` is
NOT behavior-identical either: on a same-device CPU noncontiguous strided view it
returns the ALIASED noncontiguous tensor (0 bytes allocated) where the old idiom
returned a contiguous copy. Hence this device/layout-aware branch instead of any
blind spelling. Real-CUDA D2H attestation for the fused single-copy claim rides
the standing GPU probe list.

def to_cpu_contiguous(tensor: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    """Return a detached, CPU-resident, contiguous view or copy of ``tensor``.

    Semantics match ``tensor.detach().cpu().contiguous()`` exactly — same
    LOGICAL values, standard-contiguous result, no autograd tape — while a
    cross-device dense-permuted source pays ONE host materialization instead
    of two.

    Lazy conjugate/negative dispatch bits are RESOLVED here (r8 R35, the
    one digest authority): every digest/codec consumer downstream
    reinterprets the result as a ``torch.uint8`` view, which torch refuses
    on a tensor with the conj or neg bit set, so an unresolved
    ``x.conj()`` input crashed three fingerprint sites with a bare
    RuntimeError. Resolving materializes the logical values (what every
    consumer means by "the tensor's content") and is a no-op for the
    common bit-free path.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tensor:
        Source tensor on any device, any strided layout.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        Detached contiguous CPU tensor holding the LOGICAL values (conj/neg
        bits resolved). Already-contiguous CPU inputs without lazy bits come
        back as a zero-copy detached view of the same storage, like the
        historical idiom.

    The shared uint8-reinterpret idiom behind every content digest
