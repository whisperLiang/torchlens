"""Shared-fact column blocks: the M7 FunctionCall / ParamAlias group tables.

One fact family holds the call-level (or param-level) container facts of a
finished trace ONCE per group instead of once per op row. At the core freeze
point each declared field converts exactly once:

* the **call** family groups rows by ``func_call_id`` (sol's
  ``FunctionCallGroup``): every sibling output of one wrapped call shares the
  group's canonical immutable snapshot of ``code_context``,
  ``non_tensor_pos_args``, ``non_tensor_kwargs``, ``func_non_tensor_args``,
  ``func_config``, and ``arg_names``;
* the **param** family groups rows by value (the ``ParamAliasGroup`` block
  scoped to what M6 interning does not already share): ``param_shapes``.

Canonical snapshots are immutable (`tuple`, or a tuple of items for a dict)
and interned through the trace's shared view pool, so equal facts collapse
across groups too (every op captured from one source line shares ONE
``code_context`` snapshot). Member cells hold the ``_FACT`` sentinel; the
facade descriptor hydrates the exact public container type for THAT row on
first read and caches it back, so reads are identity-stable, per-row in-place
mutation stays isolated (today's fresh-container-per-row semantics exactly),
and uninspected rows retain no per-row container.

Like M6, the conversion is differential by construction: a group member whose
value does not equal the group's first-seen value (or whose equality probe
raises) keeps its explicit cell — the block is authoritative only where it
provably reproduces the public surface. A direct write to one Op replaces the
sentinel with a per-row cell value and never mutates the shared block.
