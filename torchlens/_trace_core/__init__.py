"""Private per-trace semantic store substrate (trace_core_design.md).

One ``TraceCore`` per trace: numpy-backed typed columns, per-trace intern
pools, one canonical edge-occurrence table with CSR indexes, group tables,
an identity-preserving payload arena, sparse versioned mutation overlays,
and the facade cache. Nothing in this package is public API; public classes
(`Trace`, `Op`, ...) present rows from here as facades.

Zero production consumers until the M5 Op seam; the substrate ships with
its own unit suite (tests/test_trace_core_substrate.py) and executable
prototypes of every hard seam (copy, fork, payload identity, hydration).
