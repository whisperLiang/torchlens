"""Label-membership group tables with cached immutable views (M7).

One group row per distinct membership group (equivalence class, recurrence
group). Every member op's cell holds THE one shared :class:`GroupRef` for its
group, so a read is O(1): the ref resolves to the group's cached immutable
view (``frozenset`` for unordered groups, ``tuple`` for ordered ones). This
replaces the historical copy-on-read barrier (a fresh ``set``/``list`` per
read, O(group) each): the view is immutable, so sharing one object across
every member and every reader is alias-safe by construction.

The views are LIVE through the one sanctioned mutation path — removal scrub
calls :meth:`MembershipGroups.replace` ONCE per group, so every member
reflects the new membership on its next read without per-op rebinds and
without breaking the sharing.
