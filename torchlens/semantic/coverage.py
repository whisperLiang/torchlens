"""Facet-coverage reporting for the recipe-maintenance pipeline.

``facet_coverage`` inspects a completed trace and reports, per module record,
which facet recipes matched, which declared facets are available, and which
are absent with their typed reasons. The report is the machine-readable input
to the facet-maintenance pipeline (``tools/facet_maintenance/``): it surfaces
architecture families whose modules carry NO semantic classification so a
reviewing human or agent can decide whether a recipe is warranted. The
pipeline produces PROPOSALS FOR REVIEW only -- nothing here writes or
registers recipes. Every spelling is DOCUMENTED-UNSTABLE pending
naming-session ratification.
