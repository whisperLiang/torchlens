    A ``frozenset`` pickles in its hash-table iteration order, which for str

    identical program emitted byte-different ``metadata.pkl`` for identical
    logical content (the M6 relation views are exact frozensets of labels).
    Rewriting the reduction as ``cls(sorted_members)`` makes the persisted
    bytes hash-seed independent; ``builtins.set``/``builtins.frozenset`` are
    already on the safe-unpickler's explicit-globals allowlist, so loads
    admit the REDUCE spelling. Exact types only: subclasses keep their own
    reduce protocol.

    Deliberately the pure-Python ``pickle._Pickler``: the C pickler hardcodes
    exact set/frozenset saves and consults neither ``reducer_override`` nor
    ``dispatch_table`` for them (probed on 3.10). Metadata is the small
    sidecar of a bundle (tensor payloads ride safetensors blobs), so the
    slower Python walk is a save-time-only, determinism-buying cost.
