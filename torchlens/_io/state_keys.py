"""Narrow class-method shadow filter for portable ``__setstate__`` loads.

A portable data class rehydrates from a pickled ``state`` dict via
``self.__dict__.update(state)``. Round 54 ``sec_3`` showed that an attacker who
plants a ``state`` key shadowing a class-owned method (``_internal_set``) turns
the instance attribute into an execution boundary: ``rehydrate`` later
read-then-calls it. The primary close resolves that setter off the CLASS
(``rehydrate._assign_rehydrated_field``); this module is the defense-in-depth
enabler filter -- it refuses, at ``__setstate__`` time, any incoming state key
that shadows a class-owned *plain method / non-descriptor callable*.

The filter is deliberately NARROW. The portable dataclasses expose their real
serialized fields as ``@property`` / slot descriptors, so a *broad* "shadows any
class attribute" filter would reject legitimate state by construction (round-51
over-catch: 336 real ``@property`` collisions). Refusing only callable *methods*
had zero legitimate collisions across all portable classes (probe C2) while still
catching ``_internal_set``/``save``/``run``/``draw`` impersonation.
