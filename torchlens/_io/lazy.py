"""Lazy out reference placeholders for portable TorchLens bundles.

This module defines the lightweight references attached to lazy-loaded
outs and grads. Each ref stores the bundle path, tensor metadata,
and expected checksum so materialization can open a blob file on demand,
verify integrity, return a tensor, and close the file immediately.
