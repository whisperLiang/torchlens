"""Bounded single-worker write pipeline behind the async streaming bundle writer.

``BundleStreamWriter`` submits prepared blob-write jobs here so the slow parts
of a streamed disk save (safetensors serialization, the page-cache write, and
the sha256 integrity hash) overlap forward capture instead of pausing it. The
engine guarantees the four properties the async path must never trade away:

- ORDERING: exactly one worker thread executes jobs strictly FIFO, so manifest
  entries land in submission (= blob id) order.
- BACKPRESSURE: submission blocks while the pending snapshot bytes exceed the
  budget, so a disk slower than capture slows CAPTURE down instead of piling
  unbounded tensor snapshots into the RAM the disk save exists to spare.
- FAILURE: the first job failure latches, discards the now-pointless queue,
  and re-raises at the next writer interaction (submit or drain) so a broken
  write can never be silently absorbed.
- FINALIZATION: ``drain()`` is a hard barrier -- it returns only after every
  accepted job landed, or raises the latched failure.

The worker thread never runs wrapped torch functions: jobs receive
caller-thread-prepared CPU-contiguous snapshots and call only safetensors
serialization plus hashlib (both non-torch), and the torch-function wrapper
gate additionally passes non-owner threads through unlogged.
