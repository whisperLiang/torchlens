    r37 corr2-7 (R13): ``detach().clone()`` strips a leaf's ``requires_grad``, so
    the recorded ``grad_enabled=True`` call context became semantically inert (no
    autograd history on replay) and the exact original input was needlessly
    attestation-ineligible (fingerprint flag mismatch). The runtime mirror restores
    ``raw.requires_grad`` on the clone where legal; fingerprints stay on the
    executed-clone basis, so an intentionally changed-flag input remains a physical
    input change (attestation ``not_applicable``), never normalized away. This is
    the ONE second-clone helper -- every input-bind/state-clone/staging site routes
    through it or the staging helper's recorded-trainable rule.

    r61 corr_2: the mirror routes through the transaction ceiling's byte guard --
    the clone's ``numel()`` is the LOGICAL numel of an expanded runtime view, so a
    tampered input slot (`[1]` -> huge) with a matching runtime ``expand`` refuses
    typed at ``clone_allocation_preflight`` BEFORE the materializing clone, never
    an allocator death. Honest inputs clone with ``requires_grad`` mirrored, so
    attestation eligibility is unchanged.

    r67 C5 (corr1-2): the mirror is a PRE-EXECUTION defensive materialization, so it
    runs under the neutral ambient -- a caller inside ``torch.inference_mode()`` no
    longer mints an inference-mode mirror (which lost attestation on an otherwise
    exact run and could not carry the mirrored ``requires_grad``).
